Astrodynamics
=============

- `poliastro`_  is an open source pure Python package dedicated to problems arising in Astrodynamics and
  Orbital Mechanics, such as orbit propagation, solution of the Lambert's problem, conversion between position and
  velocity vectors and classical orbital elements and orbit plotting, focusing on interplanetary applications.
- `pykep`_ is a scientific library developed at the European Space Agency to provide basic tools for astrodynamics
  research. Algoritmic efficiency is a main focus of the library, written in C++ and exposed to Python.
- `astropy`_ package contains key functionality and common tools needed for performing astronomy and astrophysics with
  Python. It is at the core of the Astropy Project, which aims to enable the community to develop a robust
  ecosystem of Affiliated Packages covering a broad range of needs for astronomical research, data processing, and
  data analysis.
