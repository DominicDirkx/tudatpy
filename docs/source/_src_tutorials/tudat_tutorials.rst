Tudat Tutorials
===============

The `original Tudat tutorials`_ are the primary resources for learning the implementation of the Tudat libraries
written in its native language, C++. For those interested seeing the parallel implementation in Python, or those
starting from scratch with Tudat with no knowledge of C++, this is the page you're looking for. As dictated in
the `TudatPy 1.0 design philosophy`_, TudatPy is designed such that all legacy Tudat implementations (C++) are
achievable in TudatPy (Python), at least as closely as possible. This mitigates the benefit of exploiting the Python
language, but allows for direct interaction with all elements of the Tudat libraries.
