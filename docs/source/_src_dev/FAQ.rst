What's with the variable names? That's not Pythonic...
------------------------------------------------------

Prior to the 1.0.0 release, all legacy namespaces are preserved as modules and all variable names are preserved with the
exception that the function & modules are make to be snake_case according to the `PEP8`_ style guide. The length of
variable names will be reviewed during the development of the 2.0.0 release, where modules will be redesigned to take
advantage of the Python environment.
